      -inline ( This is not a good way of writing avoid this)
  - user libraries like material UI (find who maintains material UI)
  - Styed component this is also a way to style

- pros
- we get consistent Ui all the btn in app loks same

- we can use 2 framework in one project but we dont use since we have to make it consistent and ubiform
- at the end of the end it is package and it is CSS

- HW : read and explore which is the framewor present and choose the one which you feel good

  )
